Hi [Name],

I'm [Lead Manager First Name]. Just tried calling you about [Address].

It sounds like you might be weighing your options on what to do with the property.

I work with homeowners in [Neighborhood] who are in similar situations - some need to sell quickly, some just want to know what it's worth, some are testing the waters.

What makes the most sense for you right now?

No pressure either way.

VOICEMAIL: Hi [Name], [Lead Manager First Name] with REI Team. Look, I know you're probably getting bombarded with calls about [Address]. I get it - that must be overwhelming.

Here's what I'm NOT going to do: I'm not going to bug you every day or pressure you into something that doesn't make sense for you.

What I CAN do: Give you a straight answer on what we can offer and let you decide if it makes sense.

If now's not the right time, no problem. My number is [Lead Manager Phone].

1,2:00 PM,Email,Email,Value Proposition,"SUBJECT: What makes us different (probably not what you think)

Hi [Name],

You've probably heard from a bunch of ""we buy houses"" companies by now.

I'm guessing some of them sounded too good to be true?

Here's the truth: We're not going to offer you retail value. Nobody who buys cash can.

What we CAN offer:
→ A real number in 24 hours (not ""maybe"" or ""we'll see"")
→ Close on YOUR timeline (7 days or 60 days - you pick)
→ Zero repairs, zero fees, zero BS

The question is: Does that make sense for what you need right now?

If it doesn't, I totally get it. Listing with an agent might be the better move.

But if speed and simplicity matter more than squeezing every last dollar, let's talk.

What sounds more important to you - max price or fast/easy?

4,10:00 AM,Email,Email,Address the Elephant,"SUBJECT: You're probably thinking...

Hi [Name],

You're probably thinking one of these:

1. ""This sounds like a lowball""
2. ""I need to talk to my family first""
3. ""I'm not sure I'm ready to sell""
4. ""I want to see what a realtor says""

All totally valid.

Here's what I've learned working with homeowners in [Neighborhood]:

The people who sell to us are usually in one of these situations:
→ They inherited a property they don't want
→ They're tired of being a landlord
→ The house needs work they can't afford or don't want to deal with
→ They need to sell fast (divorce, relocation, financial pressure)

Does any of that sound familiar?

If not - if you have time and the house is in great shape - you'll probably get more money listing it traditionally.

But if you're in one of those situations above, we might be able to help.

What's really going on with [Address]?

7,10:00 AM,Email,Email,The Real Cost,"SUBJECT: What selling traditionally ACTUALLY costs

Hi [Name],

Let's talk about the elephant in the room.

You're probably thinking: ""If I list with a realtor, I'll get more money.""

And you might be right.

But here's what that actually looks like:

Say [Address] is worth $300k:
→ 6% realtor commission: -$18,000
→ Closing costs (2-3%): -$7,500
→ Repairs from inspection: -$5,000 to $20,000
→ Staging/photos: -$2,000
→ Time on market: 60-90 days
→ Mortgage/taxes/insurance while it sits: -$3,000+

Net after all that: ~$265,000
Time invested: 3-4 months

With us:
→ Offer: $260,000
→ Your costs: $0
→ Time to close: 10 days

So the question isn't ""who pays more.""

The question is: What's worth more to you - an extra $5,000 or 3 months of your life?

That's not a trick question. For some people, the answer is ""give me the $5k.""

For others, it's ""I just want this handled.""

Which one sounds like you?

11,2:00 PM,Call,Phone + VM,Sixth Call + Leave VM,"CALL: Hi [Name], [Lead Manager First Name]. Last call, I promise. It seems like this just isn't the right fit?

VOICEMAIL: Hey [Name], [Lead Manager First Name] here.

This is my last call. I don't want to be a pest.

I just closed on a house on [Nearby Street] last week. The homeowner was in a similar spot - inherited property, needed repairs, didn't want to deal with it.

We closed in 8 days. No inspections, no appraisals, no drama.

They told me afterward: ""I should've called you two months ago. I wasted so much time stressing about this.""

I don't know if that's you. Maybe [Address] is different.

But if you're avoiding this because it feels overwhelming, I get it.

What if it could be easier than you think?

Text me if you want to talk. If not, I won't bug you again.

[Lead Manager Phone]","SHARE a real recent example (social proof). Then say ""I don't know if that's you"" (low pressure). End with ""What if it could be easier than you think?"" to reframe their perspective. Final call."
13,10:00 AM,Email,Email,Permission to Close File,"SUBJECT: Can I close your file?

Hi [Name],

I've been trying to reach you for two weeks.

That tells me something:

Either:
a) You're not interested
b) You already handled [Address]
c) The timing just isn't right
d) I'm saying something wrong and turning you off

If it's A or B - congrats, glad it worked out. I'll close your file.

If it's C - if you think you might want to sell in 3-6 months but not now - just reply ""later"" and I'll check back with you then.

If it's D - if I've been too pushy or said something that rubbed you the wrong way - I apologize. That wasn't my intention.

But here's what I don't want to happen:

Six months from now, your situation with [Address] gets worse. Maybe the property taxes hit, or the HOA comes after you, or a pipe bursts, or a tenant trashes the place.

And you think: ""Damn, I should've called that guy back.""

I've seen it happen.

So here's my ask:

Even if now isn't the right time, save my number.

Because if things change - if you suddenly NEED to sell fast - I'm still here.

I had a homeowner ignore me for 6 months. Then her tenant destroyed the place. She called me back in a panic.

We gave her an offer in 24 hours and closed in 5 days.

She told me: ""Thank God you didn't give up on me.""

I'm not giving up on you either.

But I AM going to stop calling.

The ball's in your court.
