Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

Let's talk about the elephant in the room.

You're probably thinking: "If I list with a realtor, I'll get more money."

And you might be right.

But here's what that actually looks like:

Say {!Lead.Property_Address__c} is worth $300k:
→ 6% realtor commission: -$18,000
→ Closing costs (2-3%): -$7,500
→ Repairs from inspection: -$5,000 to $20,000
→ Staging/photos: -$2,000
→ Time on market: 60-90 days
→ Mortgage/taxes/insurance while it sits: -$3,000+

Net after all that: ~$265,000
Time invested: 3-4 months

With us:
→ Offer: $260,000
→ Your costs: $0
→ Time to close: 10 days

So the question isn't "who pays more."

The question is: What's worth more to you - an extra $5,000 or 3 months of your life?

That's not a trick question. For some people, the answer is "give me the $5k."

For others, it's "I just want this handled."

Which one sounds like you?
