Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

You've probably heard from a bunch of "we buy houses" companies by now.

I'm guessing some of them sounded too good to be true?

Here's the truth: We're not going to offer you retail value. Nobody who buys cash can.

What we CAN offer:
→ A real number in 24 hours (not "maybe" or "we'll see")
→ Close on YOUR timeline (7 days or 60 days - you pick)
→ Zero repairs, zero fees, zero BS

The question is: Does that make sense for what you need right now?

If it doesn't, I totally get it. Listing with an agent might be the better move.

But if speed and simplicity matter more than squeezing every last dollar, let's talk.

What sounds more important to you - max price or fast/easy?
